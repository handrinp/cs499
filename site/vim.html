      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that you already have Vim installed, and are working from within the bash shell environment. It's okay if you don't know what that means yet, but if you have Linux installed, then you should be good to go.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://vim.org/">the website</a>, "Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient." Vim is a text editor first and foremost. That is, the data we will be transforming with this program will be human in basic text editors on any operating system.</p>
      <p>For note taking, you can use Vim to write plain text documents. The power of the editor comes from its many keyboard shortcuts. To the seasoned Vim user, this will make it simple to write notes very efficiently.</p>
