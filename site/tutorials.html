      <h2>Syllabus</h2>
      <p>You don't really need to do each of these things in order, or even one at a time for that matter. In fact, it probably would work best if you just learn a little bit of each at a time. You don't need to be super comfortable with them all to begin the note-taking portion of this website, but it does help to be a little acquanited with each program.</p>

      <h2>Vim</h2>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim's website</a>, "Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text."</p>
      <img src="img/vimlogo.png" alt="Vim logo" class="img-right">
      <p>As a text editor, Vim has the potential to be your powerhouse and primary tool for all things text. You could use any text editor that you see fit, but Vim has an unrivaled ability to do more while typing less. And saving keystrokes is huge when you're trying to take notes during class. <em>The less time you spend typing, the more time you can spend paying attention to the professor.</em></p>
      <p>I personally learned Vim the best when I forced myself to use it for everyday programming projects. Like all things, it was slow at first but got easier over time. But unlike all things, Vim continues to get faster and faster to use.</p>
      <p>Vim has a built-in tutor, aptly named <span class="snippet">vimtutor</span>. Run that command and it will run you through the basics. If you want a more game-like experience, check out <a href="https://vim-adventures.com/" target="_blank">VIM Adventures</a>. That should teach you the basics as well.</p>

      <h2>Markdown</h2>
      <p>Markdown is probably the simplest of all 3 parts to learn. So simple in fact, that you probably don't even need a tutorial, but a simple reference chart. Bookmark <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/" target="_blank">this link</a>, because it will come in handy.</p>
      <img src="img/markdownlogo.png" alt="Markdown logo" class="img-left">
      <p>In short, Markdown is a very readable text markup language that's made to be as simple as possible. But simple doesn't mean useless - minimal is probably a better word. You may have already used markdown before without even realizing it, as many comment sections and blog interfaces already integrate Markdown syntax. For example, typing *this* to produce <strong>this</strong>, or typing _this_ to produce <em>this</em>.</p>
      <p>Technically speaking, Markdown is a program that converts simple text files into expressive HTML files. With a decent CSS file attached to it, you can have some pretty beautiful documents with very little work. And it's going to be even easier than that. You'll know what I mean when you get to the note-taking tutorial.</p>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control and file archival system. This is wildly useful for code, but it can also be a robust tool for keeping track of many text files, such as in a note-taking scenario.</p>
      <img src="img/gitlogo.png" alt="Git logo" class="img-right">
      <p>Trying to learn Git gets really hairy really fast, but you don't need to be an expert to start working on these notes. In most cases, you'll be the only one using the notes, so you won't even need that many tools in the Git toolbox. You mainly just need to know how to clone, commit, push, and pull.</p>
      <p>Again, what worked best for me when learning Git was to immerse myself in it - using it for all my coding endeavors. But other people may have better luck with online tutorials or youtube videos. <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">This website</a> claims to teach you the basics of Git in about 15 minutes, so it's worth a shot.</p>

      <h2>Moving on</h2>
      <p>With these tools at your disposal, you now have the power to take notes like a programmer. Head on over to the <a href="notetaking.html">note-taking tutorial</a> to see how.</p>
