      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome! This website has a variety of resources you can use to learn how to take notes more effectively. In short, this is accomplished using Vim, Markdown, and Git.</p>
      <p>These are each very powerful tools on their own, so it's worthwhile learning how to use them even if you don't end up taking notes with them. We'll be working under the assumption that you do want to take notes programatically.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>In order to follow along with the whole tutorial, it really helps to have access to a linux machine. These steps all can be done on Windows, but the instructions given will be for Linux. All of the software leveraged is free, and most of it is open-source.</p>

      <p>You can start by making sure you have git installed and configured. Vim is installed by default on Unix-like operating systems. It also helps to have markdown installed so you can view your notes locally, but this is not required. Many git repositories (like GitHub) have markdown rendering set up on their websites, which will come in handy later. That leads us into the next requirement, which is an account on one of these sites. For the tutorials on this site, we will use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, so make an account on there.</p>
      <p>If you already understand the basics of vim, git, and markdown, you can just skip the tutorials and head straight to the note-taking page to see how I use them. If not, then check out the tutorials page to find some good resources to get started.</p>
      <p>Once git is installed and you have a GitHub account ready to go, you're ready to get started. </p>
