CS499 Independent Study
===
During my independent study, I will work on two main goals.
1. A website to teach about the glorious combination of Vim+Markdown+Git, and their usage for programmatic
note-taking.
2. A program that can capture keystrokes, recording them in some sort of a "movie" file for playback later, which will
facilitate the teaching of Vim.
