Key Movie Recording Program
===
This program is kind of like a voluntary keylogger which can be used to record, replay, and view keystrokes over time,
kind of like a movie.
It will hopefully facilitate the learning of Vim, since Vim is very keystroke heavy.

It will either be written in Java, which I'm most comfortable with, or C/C++, which probably have better support for
such low-level things as keystrokes.
